This is a non-exhaustive list of features that are planned for the near future. If you want to get involved and contribute to this project, this is probably a good starting point.

# TODO List #
  * Photometric lights
  * Photon mapping optimizations (irradiance caching and importance sampling for final gather rays).
  * Programmable shaders.
  * Tone mapping operators for non-linear HDR->LDR mapping.
  * Image-based lighting.
  * Ambient occlusion.
  * More file format converters.
